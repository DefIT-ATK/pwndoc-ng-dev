/**
 * Manual test instructions for Tab State Persistence
 * 
 * This file provides step-by-step instructions to verify that the tab state
 * persistence feature is working correctly.
 */

/**
 * TEST 1: File Upload Persistence
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to Tool Integration page
 * 2. Go to Nessus tab
 * 3. Upload some .nessus files (don't need to be real files for this test)
 * 4. Switch to PurpleKnight tab
 * 5. Switch back to Nessus tab
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ✅ Files should still be there
 * ✅ File list should be exactly the same
 * 
 * Previous Behavior (broken):
 * ❌ Files would be cleared when switching tabs
 */

/**
 * TEST 2: Parsed Data Persistence
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Upload valid vulnerability files in any tab
 * 2. Wait for parsing to complete
 * 3. Note the number of vulnerabilities parsed
 * 4. Switch to a different tool tab
 * 5. Switch back to the original tab
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ✅ Parsed vulnerabilities should still be displayed
 * ✅ Vulnerability count should be the same
 * ✅ Debug information should still be visible
 * 
 * Previous Behavior (broken):
 * ❌ Would need to re-parse files after tab switch
 */

/**
 * TEST 3: Selection Persistence
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Parse some vulnerabilities in any tab
 * 2. Uncheck some vulnerabilities (partial selection)
 * 3. Note which ones are selected
 * 4. Switch to a different tool tab
 * 5. Switch back to the original tab
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ✅ Same vulnerabilities should be selected
 * ✅ Checkboxes should be in the same state
 * 
 * Previous Behavior (broken):
 * ❌ All selections would be lost
 */

/**
 * TEST 4: Multi-Tool Workflow
 * 
 * Comprehensive workflow test:
 * 1. Upload files in Nessus tab, parse them
 * 2. Switch to PurpleKnight tab, upload different files, parse them
 * 3. Switch to Acunetix tab, upload files, parse them
 * 4. Go back to Nessus tab
 * 5. Go back to PurpleKnight tab
 * 6. Go back to Acunetix tab
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ✅ Each tab should have its own preserved state
 * ✅ All files, parsed data, and selections should be intact
 * ✅ No cross-contamination between tabs
 * 
 * Previous Behavior (broken):
 * ❌ Only the last visited tab would retain data
 */

/**
 * TEST 5: State Clearing (Should Still Work)
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Set up files and parsed data in multiple tabs
 * 2. Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
 * 3. Navigate back to Tool Integration page
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ✅ All state should be cleared (this is expected)
 * ✅ All tabs should start empty
 * 
 * This ensures we didn't break the normal state clearing behavior.
 */

/**
 * Performance Test (Optional)
 * 
 * With all components mounted, verify there's no performance impact:
 * 1. Open browser dev tools -> Performance tab
 * 2. Load the Tool Integration page
 * 3. Switch between tabs multiple times
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * ✅ Tab switching should be instant (no re-rendering delays)
 * ✅ Memory usage should be reasonable
 * ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
